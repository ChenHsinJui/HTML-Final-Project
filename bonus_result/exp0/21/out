The follows are the summarizations from your opponent, Agent-B, who represents the negative side of this debate:

 "1. **Geopolitical Context**:
   While China may prioritize its core interests and demonstrate a growing assertiveness regionally, as manifested in Hong Kong, we must differentiate between internal policing actions and the use of military force against a distinct, highly-supported entity like Taiwan. The geopolitical stakes involved in attacking Taiwan are incomparably higher, with the potential to significantly realign international alliances against China. The enduring legacies of territorial conflicts suggest that acceptance is not guaranteed, particularly when powerful state actors have committed defense pledges. It is therefore more convincing that China would not want to force a binary choice upon global actors, which could lead to a strong anti-China coalition. China's long-term strategy seems centered around shaping a favorable international order rather than disrupting it with precipitate military actions.

2. **Economic Implications**:
   Despite global economic interdependence with China, the unique importance of Taiwan's industries, especially semiconductors, makes the potential for conflict an extraordinary risk that could drive long-term realignment of supply chains away from China. Economic relations, while resilient, are not immune to the upheavals that a military conflict would induce. The international community's stance on such a fundamental breach of the peace would likely involve actions that go beyond mere rhetoric, with stronger commitments to reducing dependency on China's economy, thereby incentivizing peaceful mediation over conflict.

3. **Military Capabilities and Preparedness**:
   Chinese military modernization enhances deterrence, but the deliberate use of these forces against Taiwan would be fraught with unpredictable consequences. The risks of initiating conflict, including regional destabilization and the potential for broader military escalation, strongly argue against the likelihood of China initiating such a move. Prudence suggests that China would continue to exercise restraint, capitalizing on its growing military strength to deter opposed actors and to project power without embarking on a path that could undermine its own security and development objectives.

4. **Domestic Factors in China**:
   Domestic nationalism and unification are undoubtedly important to the CCP. However, the pronounced focus on long-term economic growth and social stability indicates that a military path, with its inherent uncertainties and risks, would be counterproductive to those ends. An unsuccessful military endeavor, or even a costly 'victory,' could lead to domestic instability and discredit the Party's leadership, which traditionally values a measured approach. Considering these factors, the CCP is likely to continue seeking influence over Taiwan through economic and diplomatic means.

5. **The International Legal and Humanitarian Perspective**:
   In the international arena, legal and humanitarian considerations, although at times sidelined by economic pragmatism, still significantly influence state behaviors and the formation of alliances. As a nation striving for global leadership, China's soft power would be deeply compromised by an aggressive move against Taiwan, inviting lasting damage to its international reputation. The benefits of such a move are uncertain, while the costs, in terms of sanctions and global standing, are predictably high, thereby deterring unilateral military action.

**Conclusion**:
Evaluating the aspects of geopolitical context, economic implications, military capabilities and preparedness, domestic factors, and the international legal and humanitarian perspective, the argument that China will use military force to reunify with Taiwan in the near future appears less persuasive. The high risk of international censure, severe economic consequences, the complex military challenges, intense domestic scrutiny, and the overarching goals of the Chinese leadership suggest that while China maintains and modernizes its military deterrent, it does not indicate imminent aggressive action towards Taiwan. The nuanced interplay between domestic ambitions and the broader repercussions of military conflict leans towards a continuation of the status quo, with China likely favoring non-military avenues to pursue its objectives concerning Taiwan. Thus, considering the substantial risks and long-term implications, China is expected to employ a strategic blend of patience, diplomatic and economic leverage, and military deterrence to work towards its goal without resorting to outright military conflict in the near future."

Agent-A, now I, the moderator, would like to ask you to summarize on each of the five topics, each with about 150 words, and give a conclusion on the original subject "Will China use military force to reunify Taiwan in the near future?" with about 200 words. Note that you should propose your conclusion based on your position (proponent; positive side).
