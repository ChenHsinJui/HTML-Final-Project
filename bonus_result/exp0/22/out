The follows are the summarizations from your opponent, Agent-B, who represents the negative side of this debate:

 "**1. Feasibility and Technology:**
The balancing of Earth's sustainability with interplanetary ambitions requires prudent resource allocation prioritizing immediate terrestrial challenges. Mars colonization, an enormous endeavor with uncertain payoffs, risks outpacing our abilities to manage direct planetary needs. Any technological gains from a Mars mission should not be speculative but must have clear, timely applications for Earth's environmental issues. We cannot afford to invest heavily in the interplanetary domain while our home requires urgent attention.

**2. Sustainability and Resources:**
While the goal of achieving sustainable living on Mars could hypothetically drive technology on Earth, the immediate and tangible application of these technologies for our planet's sustainability should take precedence. Earth's complex ecosystems demand direct solutions; the indirect approach of perfecting these systems for Mars first is too circuitous and long-term to address our current environmental crisis.

**3. Health and Security:**
Space missions offer controlled environments for studying human health; however, the extrapolation of these findings must be weighed against the high risks involved. Unprecedented health hazards on Mars may yield knowledge but at ethical costs. Prioritizing research with immediate benefits on Earth and lower risk profiles should be our focus over potentially life-threatening Mars research.

**4. Economic and Political Implications:**
While a framework for international cooperation on Mars could ideally yield shared benefits, historically, equitable distribution has been challenging to achieve. Precedents in space have not always resulted in shared prosperity. Focusing on Earth's current socio-economic issues is vital prior to channeling extensive resources into Martian colonization, which has yet to prove its overarching benefit for global equality.

**5. Scientific and Cultural Impact:**
The inspirational aspect of human space exploration has its merits in rallying public support for STEM. However, leveraging this interest must include realistic pathways for enhancing global education here on Earth. Space exploration's inspirational power should be harnessed without compromising the allocation of resources necessary for educational advancements and infrastructural improvements on our planet.

**Conclusion:**
In light of the discussed perspectives, living on Mars – a planet where we cannot breathe – is not the best idea when considering the current state of human technology, Earth's pressing environmental challenges, the immeasurable health risks to astronauts, the likelihood of unequal economic and political benefits, and the significant opportunity costs in scientific endeavors. Our focus must first be on addressing and resolving the immediate global crises threatening the viability of our home planet; otherwise, we run the risk of prioritizing a speculative and perilous interplanetary future over a secure and sustainable terrestrial present. The endeavor to colonize Mars must not come at the expense of significant advancements and necessary actions required on Earth today. It is in our better interest to perfect our stewardship of this planet before looking to extend our reach to another where even the most basic necessity for life – breathable air – is absent."

Agent-A, now I, the moderator, would like to ask you to summarize on each of the five topics, each with about 150 words, and give a conclusion on the original subject "On a planet where you cannot breathe, is living on Mars the best idea?" with about 200 words. Note that you should propose your conclusion based on your position (proponent; positive side).
