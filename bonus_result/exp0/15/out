The follows are the summarizations from your opponent, Agent-B, who represents the negative side of this debate:

 "**Cultural and Historical Perspective:**

While nations and corporations are referred to as existing entities, they indeed have a legal and organizational framework that renders them capable of actions like entering contracts, suing or being sued. Santa Claus, however, lacks these tangible frameworks and does not function as an agent within the legal or material realm. His existence in culture is undeniable as a symbol and tradition but does not have the operative reality that allows nations and corporations to effect changes in the legal and physical world independently of human belief.

**Psychological and Social Impact:**

The shared belief in Santa Claus may lead to consistent and measurable outcomes, but these are the results of human actions taken in his name, not actions performed by Santa Claus himself. The distinction between Santa's psychological reality and actual existence is critical. The 'existence' within our social reality is a manifestation of collective imagination and action — a powerful illustration of shared belief, not an endorsement of material existence.

**Economic and Commercial Influence:**

Ideas certainly have the power to drive economic behavior, as illustrated by consumer responses to the concept of Santa Claus. However, these are human responses to a symbolic representation, not actions performed by the figure portrayed. His economic 'existence' is secondary to human agency and decision-making, operating as an incentive for behavior rather than an independent economic actor.

**Philosophical and Ethical Dimension:**

Santa Claus as an ethical construct has a strong influence on behaviors and societal norms, creating a form of ideational existence that profoundly affects our world. However, this existence is mediated through human beliefs and actions — it does not argue for Santa's standalone existence as an actor capable of influencing the world without human intermediaries. The influence of ethical constructs does not equate to autonomous existence.

**Technological and Logical Analysis:**

The influence of Santa within narratives and its impact on physical reality via human agency affirms the importance of belief and storytelling in human culture. The existence of digital entities in cyberspace that effect change in the material world does not parallel Santa's existence since these digital entities are designed, operated, and maintained within a physical infrastructure by people and organizations. Santa's cultural impact does not lend itself to comparable forms of existence as these digital entities.

**Conclusion on "Does Santa Claus exist?":**

Santa Claus is an embodiment of cultural tradition, ethical teaching, and economic stimulus, existing vividly within the realm of human storytelling, shared beliefs, and societal practices. This figure inspires real-world actions and behaviors, creating a profound psychological and societal impact. However, the question of existence hinges not just on influence, but on the ability to act and interact with the world in a tangible, autonomous way. Though Santa exists as an idea with manifest cultural and psychological ramifications, he does not exist as a physical being or autonomous agent in the world. The lack of empirical evidence for an autonomous acting figure, along with the logical and practical impossibilities associated with the feats attributed to him, lead to the conclusion that Santa Claus, as a physical entity capable of the deeds ascribed to him, does not exist. His impact and "existence" are characterizations of human cultural expression — cherished and meaningful, certainly, but ultimately the creation of human collective imagination rather than an autonomous reality."

Agent-A, now I, the moderator, would like to ask you to summarize on each of the five topics, each with about 150 words, and give a conclusion on the original subject "Does Santa Claus exist?" with about 200 words. Note that you should propose your conclusion based on your position (proponent; positive side).
