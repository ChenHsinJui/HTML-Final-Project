The follows are the summarizations from your opponent, Agent-B, who represents the negative side of this debate:

 "**1. Communication Accessibility:**

Technology indeed furnishes us with innovative communication tools, yet despite these advancements, the propensity for significant, in-depth interaction is often undermined by an over-reliance on technology's convenience. The resulting superficial exchanges lack the emotional impact and personal touch intrinsic to face-to-face communication. My assertion remains that while technology can maintain connections over distances, it often does so at the cost of relationship quality. While educational initiatives on effective digital communication are valuable, they do not fully compensate for the inherent shortcomings of digital interaction compared to personal, direct human contact.

**2. Global Connectivity:**

Technology can democratize the dissemination of cultural narratives, but it must be met with proactive measures to prevent the homogenization of cultures. Cultural depth risks dilution within the vastness of the digital landscape. It is possible to strive for a respectful online culture, yet the persistent challenge is how technology can facilitate meaningful cultural exchange without reducing it to consumable content stripped of its roots and significance.

**3. Effect on Social Skills and Interpersonal Relationships:**

The versatility afforded by digital platforms can enrich our social toolkits, but they cannot replicate the full spectrum of face-to-face interaction. Online environments often provide a controlled, edited version of life, potentially impairing the development of genuine social skills required in the spontaneous and multifaceted real world. While balancing digital and physical interactions is ideal, the complexity and unpredictability of real-life encounters necessitate a level of social adeptness that may be stifled by an overemphasis on digital communication.

**4. Technological Overload and Mental Health:**

The necessity of considering the mental health implications of technological design is undeniable. However, current usage patterns often exacerbate stress, anxiety, and a sense of disconnection. Striving towards ethical technology usage is crucial, yet this does not guarantee a swift resolution to the adverse mental health impacts already being experienced. Moreover, the rapid pace of technological advancements can outstrip society's capacity to adapt healthily.

**5. Inclusivity and Accessibility:**

Technological advances have the potential to bridge gaps in accessibility and inclusivity, but we must critically acknowledge that the digital divide persists and is problematic. Decisive action and investment in policy and infrastructural support are needed to realize technology's potential for inclusivity. The trajectory toward equality is promising, but progress should not overshadow the immediate and tangible barriers that continue to exist for many.

**Conclusion:**

While technology has revolutionized our ability to communicate and connect globally, it does not unequivocally strengthen human connections. The debate has illuminated how digital communication often trades depth for breadth, sometimes favoring convenience over substantial interaction. Global connectivity, while opening doors to cultural exchange, also risks homogenizing and commodifying rich cultural identities. With respect to social skills and mental health, reliance on digital interaction can foster environments that inadequately prepare individuals for the full range of human emotions and experiences encountered in day-to-day life. Inclusivity remains a work in progress, with technology's promise sometimes falling short for those who are on the far side of the digital divide.

Thus, while technology certainly maintains connections, the contention that it strengthens them is not sufficiently supported. It presents a paradox where the same tools that bring us together can also foster distance and detachment. It is the quality and depth of human connection that suffers in the glare of our screens, prompting a re-examination of the role of technology in truly bringing us closer together."

Agent-A, now I, the moderator, would like to ask you to summarize on each of the five topics, each with about 150 words, and give a conclusion on the original subject "Does technology strengthen connections between people?" with about 200 words. Note that you should propose your conclusion based on your position (proponent; positive side).
