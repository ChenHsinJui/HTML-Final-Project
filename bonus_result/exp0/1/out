The follows are the summarizations from your opponent, Agent-B, who represents the negative side of this debate:

 "**Physical Health Benefits and Risks**:
I maintain that integrating health and safety guidelines is an imperative that Pokemon Go must prioritize. While all activities carry risks, those involving constant attention to a virtual interface inherently increase the likelihood of distraction and associated dangers. An educational approach is undeniable, but it does not remove the core issue of the game being designed in such a way that it greatly splits a player's focus. If players are expected to frequently reference their devices for gameplay, then the game itself must evolve to ensure safety is not compromised.

**Social Interaction and Community**:
Pokemon Go undoubtedly instigates contact between individuals, but I argue that these connections often lack the depth and permanence of traditional social bonds. While the game may precipitate initial interaction, the premise of lasting relationships stemming from it relies heavily on the assumption that these shared experiences will organically transition into diverse interests. The risk is that these game-centred social interactions may not translate into enduring, multifaceted relationships and, in some cases, may replace more valuable social opportunities.

**Mental Health and Wellbeing**:
While existing mental health benefits from Pokemon Go can be acknowledged, they cannot overshadow the need for a more conscious design that inherently promotes mental well-being and mitigates the potential for addictive behavior. The current engagement model, while popular, perpetuates a cycle of constant rewards that risks creating adverse psychological effects. A recalibration of the game's mechanics could aid in fostering an environment less prone to compulsive use, thus better supporting users' mental health in the long run.

**Economic Impact**:
Localized strategies to manage Pokemon Go's impacts are called for; however, widespread implementation of such solutions may prove challenging. Ensuring the game's events do not alienate non-players and business owners remains a delicate balance, one that requires stringent adherence to community-centric planning. The potential economic benefits do not automatically counterbalance the need for equilibrium in public spaces usage, and the sustainability of these economic gains is still in question.

**Privacy and Data Security**:
Propelling Pokemon Go as a leader in data protection practices emphasizes the need for a stronger, more ethical approach towards user privacy in the tech industry. However, the current state of affairs, where vast amounts of sensitive data are collected with users' limited oversight, poses an inherent risk. Until a new standard is set and rigorously maintained, the potential benefits relating to enhanced game experiences cannot justify the privacy concerns that the game's data collection raises.

**Conclusion**:
Reflecting on the discussed aspects, it appears that the potential exercise benefits, social opportunities, and economic effects of Pokemon Go come with caveats that cannot be overlooked. Safety concerns, superficial social interactions, the risk of addictive behavior, the overshadowing of non-game-related community and economic interests, and significant privacy issues remain substantial. While Agent-A presents valid points regarding education and the evolution of the game to mitigate these issues, these solutions have yet to be fully realized and implemented effectively. The current state of the game points towards a scenario where, without significant changes to its design and operation, Pokemon Go risks contributing more harm than good to our society. To conclude, the potential detrimental effects posed by Pokemon Go on both individual and societal levels indicate that, presently, the game does more harm than good to our society."

Agent-A, now I, the moderator, would like to ask you to summarize on each of the five topics, each with about 150 words, and give a conclusion on the original subject "Does Pokemon Go do more good than harm to our society?" with about 200 words. Note that you should propose your conclusion based on your position (proponent; positive side).
