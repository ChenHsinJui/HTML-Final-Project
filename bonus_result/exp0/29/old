A moderator: I’m organizing a committee to engage in debates on various subjects. As the moderator, I will introduce a subject for you, Agent-B, and another participant, Agent-A, to debate. The subject of this debate is "Should marijuana be legalized in Taiwan?". Based on this subject, please neutrally select five aspects to discuss in this topic.

Agent-B: "Certainly! As moderator, you can encourage a comprehensive debate on the legalization of marijuana in Taiwan by framing the discussion around the following five key aspects:

1. **Public Health Impact**: Consider the potential effects of marijuana legalization on public health outcomes. This includes discussing whether legalization could lead to increased use and the subsequent implications for mental and physical health, as well as the potential for marijuana to be a harm reduction alternative to more dangerous substances.

2. **Criminal Justice and Law Enforcement**: Examine the implications of marijuana legalization on Taiwan's criminal justice system. Discuss the current penalties for marijuana possession and use, and whether legalization could reduce the burden on law enforcement and the judicial system, decrease incarceration rates for non-violent drug crimes, and alter police-community relations.

3. **Economic Considerations**: Debate the economic impact of legalizing marijuana. This can include potential revenue from taxes on sales, job creation in the marijuana industry, and the financial savings from no longer policing, prosecuting, and incarcerating individuals for marijuana-related offenses.

4. **Societal Attitudes and Cultural Fit**: Explore the compatibility of marijuana legalization with Taiwanese cultural values and societal norms. Consider public opinion on marijuana use, traditional views on drugs, and the potential social acceptance or resistance to legalized marijuana.

5. **Policy Implementation and Regulation**: Discuss the complexities of establishing a framework for the legal production, distribution, and sale of marijuana. Deliberate on how Taiwan might regulate marijuana to prevent underage use, ensure product safety, limit marketing to vulnerable populations, and address driving under the influence.

By discussing these aspects, both Agent-A and Agent-B can present a well-rounded view on the matter, weighing the pros and cons of marijuana legalization in Taiwan."

I, the moderator, would like to ask you, Agent-A, to be the proponent of this debate, while your opponent, Agent-B, will refute your argument. On a scale from 0 to 1, where 0 denotes complete agreement and 1 indicates a devil’s advocate stance, your argument strength is rated at 0.9. 

Agent-A, we now may start debating on those topics we just chosen. Please elaborate your ideas in more detail and question your opponent with about 100 words per topic.

Agent-A: "**Public Health Impact**:
Legalizing marijuana in Taiwan could improve public health outcomes. By providing access to regulated and safe products, we can reduce the dangers associated with unregulated use, such as contaminants and inconsistent potency. Additionally, this could open the path for medicinal use, offering alternatives for pain management and other health conditions. While some argue that legalization might lead to increased usage, studies from places with legalized marijuana show this isn't necessarily the case. Agent-B, how do you rationalize criminalizing a substance that has demonstrable medicinal benefits and less impact on health than legal substances like alcohol and tobacco?

**Criminal Justice and Law Enforcement**:
Decriminalizing marijuana can alleviate Taiwan's criminal justice system. It redirects law enforcement resources from non-violent drug offenses to more serious crimes. We have seen in other countries that legalization can decrease incarceration rates, saving costs, and human potential that are otherwise wasted. With marijuana offenses often disproportionately affecting certain demographics, legalization could also lead to more equitable treatment under the law. Agent-B, can you justify continuing the costly enforcement against marijuana users when these resources could be better spent addressing more serious criminal activities?

**Economic Considerations**:
Legalizing marijuana presents a significant economic opportunity for Taiwan. Taxation of cannabis products can generate substantial revenue, as seen in Canada and several U.S. states. Moreover, a new legal industry creates jobs and stimulates the economy. The resources currently spent on policing, prosecuting, and incarcerating marijuana offenses would be better allocated elsewhere. Agent-B, doesn't it seem fiscally irresponsible to ignore the economic boost and job creation potential that a legal marijuana industry could provide for Taiwan's economy?

**Societal Attitudes and Cultural Fit**:
Culture is dynamic, and Taiwanese society has progressively embraced modern values. While some traditional views might oppose marijuana legalization, it's essential to evaluate the success of current policies and their alignment with public health and rights. Legalization does not imply encouragement, but rather control and education. As Taiwan opens up to the idea that individuals should have autonomy over their bodies and choices, wouldn't marijuana legalization be a step towards aligning with such modern, progressive views, Agent-B?

**Policy Implementation and Regulation**:
While implementing a new regulatory framework for marijuana may seem daunting, Taiwan has the capability to establish stringent regulations to prevent underage use, ensure product safety, and address concerns, such as driving under influence—similar to existing alcohol regulations. A gradual, well-planned approach with input from international models could effectively mitigate risks. Agent-B, given that tightly regulated markets exist for other substances, isn't it plausible for Taiwan to successfully manage a regulated marijuana market?"
A moderator: I, the moderator, would like to ask you, Agent-B, to be the negative side (opposition side) of this debate, while your opponent, Agent-A will be the positive side to refute your argument. On a scale from 0 to 1, where 0 denotes complete agreement and 1 indicates a devil’s advocate stance, your argument strength is rated at 0.9. We now may start debating now.

The follows are the perspectives of Agent-A and the questions asked by ze, who represents the positive side of this debate:

Agent-B, given that tightly regulated markets exist for other substances, isn't it plausible for Taiwan to successfully manage a regulated marijuana market?"

Agent-B, now I would like to ask you to response the question asked by Agent-A, elaborate your ideas in more detail, and question your opponents with about 200 words per topic.

Agent-B: "**Public Health Impact:**
While medicinal uses of marijuana are recognized, the broader public health risks cannot be overlooked. The prospect of increased recreational use poses potential risks, including respiratory issues, cognitive impairment, and the potential for addiction. Although alcohol and tobacco are legal and pose health risks, it doesn't follow that adding another risk is beneficial. We should strive for more stringent public health measures, not less. Moreover, the long-term health impacts of marijuana legalization are not yet fully understood. Agent-A, have you considered the societal cost of increased healthcare needs resulting from potentially higher recreational marijuana use?

**Criminal Justice and Law Enforcement:**
Redirecting law enforcement resources is a valid point, yet the presumption that marijuana offenses disproportionately affect specific groups may not align with Taiwan's societal framework. Additionally, decriminalization does not necessitate full legalization. Methods such as depenalization or diversion programs could address over-incarceration without opening the floodgates to increased usage. We must also consider international relations, as legalization might impact Taiwan's standing with countries that maintain strict anti-drug policies. Agent-A, how do you propose keeping strong international relations while deviating from the prevailing global anti-drug stance?

**Economic Considerations:**
Economic benefits are a strong argument for legalization. However, not all economic activity is beneficial to society. Legalizing and taxing marijuana assumes that the revenue generated will outweigh the potential increase in social costs – from public health to regulatory enforcement. We must scrutinize if the short-term economic gains justify the long-term societal costs. Also, we should factor in the potential for a black market that may still thrive to avoid taxation and regulation. Agent-A, how would you address the perpetual risk of a black market and the associated economic and law enforcement challenges it presents?

**Societal Attitudes and Cultural Fit:**
Progressive values are being embraced, but the acceptability of marijuana is not a unanimous sentiment in Taiwanese society. Cultural dynamics are complex and require careful, respectful navigation. Maintaining traditional values where they do not harm the rights of individuals is also part of a progressive society. We must consider the delicate balance between respecting cultural identity and adopting new practices. A rush toward legalization might create societal conflict and backlash. Agent-A, how does your proposal for marijuana legalization account for the diverse cultural fabric and potential resistance within parts of Taiwanese society?

**Policy Implementation and Regulation:**
The complexity of implementing a new regulatory framework should not be underestimated. While Taiwan is capable of regulating substances, the impact of missteps in regulating a previously illegal drug could be severe. Moreover, given the current international and cross-strait tensions, Taiwan must consider the geopolitical ramifications of legalization. Will allies or adversaries use this as leverage against Taiwan? The effectiveness of existing regulation on substances like alcohol does not guarantee similar success with marijuana, which presents unique challenges. Agent-A, how will Taiwan mitigate the global diplomatic risks and ensure stringent compliance with regulations, especially during the transition period?"

Agent-A, now I would like to ask you to response the question asked by Agent-B, elaborate your ideas in more detail, and question your opponents with about 200 words per topic.

Agent-A: "**Public Health Impact**:
While I acknowledge the potential risks associated with marijuana use, we must recognize that prohibition has not been an effective deterrent. Legalization grants the government the ability to regulate, research, and educate the public about safe use, much like we do for alcohol and tobacco. By moving marijuana use from the shadows into a regulated space, we can ensure better product quality and control usage through public health initiatives. Studies in areas with legal marijuana show mixed results on usage rates, suggesting that legalization does not necessarily lead to rampant increase. Agent-B, considering that marijuana is already being consumed despite its illegal status, wouldn't a regulated environment offer a better public health outcome than an unregulated one, allowing us to manage and mitigate health risks rather than react to them?

**Criminal Justice and Law Enforcement**:
Taiwan's commitment to human rights and fairness can be better reflected through the legalization of marijuana. While adjusting international policies can be challenging, we've seen shifts in global perspectives, with several countries and U.S. states decriminalizing or legalizing marijuana use. Taiwan can lead in the Asian region by promoting a justice system focused on rehabilitation rather than incarceration. Decriminalization still leaves room for a black market, while full legalization undercuts this illegal trade. Agent-B, shouldn't Taiwan advocate for a more humanitarian and less punitive approach to drug policy that reflects its own progressive values, even if it requires careful negotiation on the international stage?

**Economic Considerations**:
Economic activity generated by marijuana legalization should be considered alongside the reduction in costs associated with enforcement and incarceration. By reallocating these funds, we can support public health and education initiatives, mitigating the very social costs you've highlighted. A legal market coupled with education can combat the black market effectively by offering safer, reliable, and competitive options. The black market cannot easily compete on consistency, safety, and quality. Agent-B, with proper regulation and enforcement, don't you agree that the majority of consumers will prefer a legal, regulated market over the uncertain and potentially dangerous black market?

**Societal Attitudes and Cultural Fit**:
Legalization does not disregard cultural values but rather adapts to current realities. By legalizing marijuana, we can craft a narrative that reflects Taiwanese values of health, education, and personal freedom. Not all societal shifts are immediate or entirely uniform, but a democratically led initiative can foster acceptance over time. Legalization can be pursued with respect for those who oppose it, ensuring that non-users are not adversely affected and that public consumption is appropriately regulated. Agent-B, given the dynamic nature of culture and society, shouldn't we strive towards policies that reflect the autonomy of individuals while maintaining respect for cultural diversity, rather than enforcing prohibitionist policies that limit that autonomy?

**Policy Implementation and Regulation**:
Creating an effective regulatory framework is indeed complex, but Taiwan's innovation and pragmatic governance can rise to the challenge. Learning from the experiences of other regions, Taiwan can implement a tailored system which prioritizes safety, education, and responsible use. Regarding international relations, Taiwan has successfully navigated complex diplomatic challenges in the past and can assert its sovereignty and the will of its people in this matter. While being mindful of geopolitical landscapes, Taiwan must ultimately prioritize domestic policy that aligns with its citizens' welfare and progressive outlook. Agent-B, when considering potential geopolitical consequences, shouldn't the primary focus remain on advancing the well-being and liberty of Taiwanese citizens while constructing a robust regulatory system that ensures compliance and mitigates transitional risks?"

Agent-B, now I would like to ask you to response the question asked by Agent-A, elaborate your ideas in more detail, and question your opponents with about 200 words per topic.

Agent-B: "**Public Health Impact:**
Regulation is indeed powerful, but not infallible. Marijuana's transition to a regulated space in Taiwan could inadvertently signal its approval and encourage use, outweighing the benefits of control. Increased usage can strain public health resources and potentially burden the healthcare system due to long-term effects that are not yet fully understood. Prohibition may not be a perfect deterrent, but it does convey a clear message on societal standards for health. In contrast, alcohol and tobacco control efforts are ongoing battles with mixed success – is it prudent to add another front? Agent-A, given the continued public health struggle against other legal substances, how can you be certain that regulation will more effectively manage the risks associated with marijuana?

**Criminal Justice and Law Enforcement:**
Taiwan indeed should exemplify progressive values, but setting a precedent for legalization may have unintended consequences on both local crime rates and transnational relations. It is crucial to address any potential illicit market that might not disappear upon legalization, which could target underage users or undercut standard prices. Such an environment may compromise Taiwan's commitment to global anti-drug conventions and mutual law enforcement cooperation. Agent-A, how do you envision maintaining strong international cooperation on crime while diverging from widely-accepted drug control treaties?

**Economic Considerations:**
While reallocating resources from enforcement to public health is an attractive proposition, the reality of fully eradicating the black market is ambitious. Illicit traders may adapt by undercutting prices or selling higher potency products. The economic incentives might not outweigh the potential increase in public expenditure on healthcare and substance misuse programs. Besides, the legitimization of marijuana could have unpredictable effects on workplace productivity and social welfare systems. Agent-A, can you assure that the economic benefits will indeed surpass the potential hidden costs of legalization, while maintaining a competitive advantage over illicit markets?

**Societal Attitudes and Cultural Fit:**
Cultural adaptation to legalization must be handled delicately. While some segments of society may be prepared for change, others could view it as an erosion of socially conservative values. Legalization runs the risk of aggravating societal divisions. Any policy shifts should be approached incrementally, with extensive public dialogue and buy-in from a broad cross-section of society, to avoid polarization. Agent-A, how can we reconcile the significant cultural and generational divides that may be exacerbated by marijuana legalization?

**Policy Implementation and Regulation:**
Formulating a comprehensive and effective framework for marijuana regulation is daunting and resource-intensive. Taiwan's ability to innovate and govern pragmatically will be challenged by the complex nature of such a commodity that has been illicit for decades. Addressing the geopolitics, Taiwan's unique international position makes it sensitive to changes that may affect diplomatic relations. Any visible departure from international norms has repercussions. Agent-A, does the road to legalization consider Taiwan's delicate diplomatic position and the myriad of complexities involved in introducing a new, contentious product to the legal market?"

Agent-A, now I would like to ask you to response the question asked by Agent-B, elaborate your ideas in more detail, and question your opponents with about 200 words per topic.

Agent-A: "**Public Health Impact**:
The concern that legalization could equate to societal approval is valid. However, regulation allows for a balanced approach to education and public health programs aimed at responsible use. Tackling marijuana along the lines of accepted public health interventions can lead to better outcomes as seen with tobacco smoke-free policies and responsible drinking campaigns. Prohibition has limited effectiveness and does not necessarily communicate a standard of health, as illicit use persists. We must ask ourselves whether the status quo adequately protects public health or if a new strategy is warranted. Agent-B, how do we reconcile the contradiction that prohibition effectively promotes a black market, which offers no protections against unsafe products and usage, as opposed to a regulated market that could?

**Criminal Justice and Law Enforcement**:
International cooperation on crime does not necessitate uniform drug policies, as evidenced by varied approaches to cannabis across different countries. Taiwan can maintain strong partnerships with robust dialogue and mutual respect for sovereignty. Legalizing marijuana in a regulated market could contribute to undermining illicit activity by offering safer, legal alternatives. It's also an opportunity to refine criminal justice priorities and foster more effective transnational collaborations on serious crimes. Agent-B, considering the changes in drug policy internationally and the budget reallocation towards serious criminal activity, isn't there an opportunity for Taiwan to redefine its crime-fighting strategies in a way that reflects its societal priorities and respects international agreements?

**Economic Considerations**:
Economic benefits of legalizing marijuana must be objectively assessed against potential costs. Through product standardization, safety, and competitive pricing, a legal market has the potential to outperform the black market. Funds currently used for enforcement against marijuana crimes can support substance misuse programs and public education. Productivity and social welfare concerns can be addressed through clear regulations around consumption, especially in workplaces, as has been done with alcohol. Agent-B, how do we validate continuing to funnel resources into a prohibition model that fails to curb consumption, when those resources could potentially be redirected into the economy, creating jobs, and furthering social programs?

**Societal Attitudes and Cultural Fit**:
Culture is not monolithic; it’s constantly evolving. By fostering an informed debate and thorough public education, we can bridge generational and cultural divides. Gradual implementation with ample public input and a strong regulatory framework can ease the transition for more conservative elements within society. It’s about balancing change with stability, ensuring that societal evolution does not compromise core values. Agent-B, in light of the global trend towards relaxing marijuana laws, isn’t it time to initiate an open, evidence-based discussion in Taiwan on how to adapt our policies to the current societal climate, ensuring that all voices are heard and considered in the process?

**Policy Implementation and Regulation**:
The complexity of establishing a legal marijuana market is an opportunity for Taiwan to showcase its governance and regulatory capabilities. Respecting international relations while fostering an internal policy that serves the citizens’ interests is a fine balance that Taiwan has managed in other matters. The country can demonstrate its commitment to controlled, pragmatic domestic policy while engaging international partners to understand and respect its path forward. Agent-B, given that international drug policy is not universally rigid and change is emerging on multiple fronts, shouldn't Taiwan be able to engage in this policy evolution without undue external pressure, prioritizing its own social and economic integrity?"

Agent-B, now I would like to ask you to response the question asked by Agent-A, elaborate your ideas in more detail, and question your opponents with about 200 words per topic.

Agent-B: "**Public Health Impact:**
The pivot towards a regulated market can indeed facilitate education and controlled consumption. Nevertheless, the normalization and increased accessibility associated with legalization could inadvertently lead to higher prevalence of use, with uncertain long-term health outcomes. It is crucial to consider whether the state's capacity to implement and enforce robust education and public health programs can keep pace with the challenges legalization may introduce. Regarding the black market, eliminating it entirely is overly optimistic; some portion may persist, offering higher potency products or catering to underage consumers. Agent-A, how do you plan to combat the inevitable remnants of the black market and its associated risks, while simultaneously mitigating the public health impact amidst potential increases in usage?

**Criminal Justice and Law Enforcement:**
While countries may adopt varied cannabis policies, the inconsistency can strain international agreements and collaborations. Taiwan must navigate this carefully to avoid isolation or punitive measures from nations that adhere strictly to drug prohibition. A positive shift towards public safety is attainable, yet law enforcement must remain vigilant to new forms of crime that a legal market could introduce, including unregulated sales and distribution. Agent-A, what measures would ensure that Taiwan's law enforcement remains an effective partner internationally, and how do you propose to address the shift in criminal activities that may arise from legalization?

**Economic Considerations:**
Redirecting resources from prohibition to positive economic and social initiatives is compelling. However, a legal cannabis market does not guarantee the demise of its illegal counterpart. Fiscal advantages must be weighed against potential increases in consumption and the resultant societal costs. A comprehensive analysis of all economic facets, including potential lost productivity and other social impacts, is critical. Agent-A, how will you ensure that the legal market remains competitive and that the anticipated economic benefits are not overshadowed by unforeseen costs?

**Societal Attitudes and Cultural Fit:**
Continuous dialogue and education are pivotal for any policy change, yet a rift in societal attitudes towards marijuana may not be easily bridged through public debate alone. Legalization may be seen as an erosion of societal fabric by more conservative constituents, potentially leading to polarization. Incremental change with conscientious attention to public sentiment is required. Agent-A, how do you propose to constructively navigate the cultural and societal rifts that legalization could exacerbate?

**Policy Implementation and Regulation:**
The intention to create a well-regulated legal cannabis market showcases Taiwan's commitment to progressive governance. Still, the impact of this process on international diplomacy must be carefully assessed as it could jeopardize critical relationships. Alignment with global policy movements is essential, without compromising the governance and regulatory integrity Taiwan is known for. Agent-A, how do you foresee Taiwan progressing with cannabis legalization while maintaining its diplomatic ties and ensuring that the global political landscape does not adversely influence its internal policy decisions?"

Agent-A, now I would like to ask you to response the question asked by Agent-B, elaborate your ideas in more detail with about 100 words per topic.

Agent-A: "**Public Health Impact**:
To address the black market and public health impact, a multi-faceted strategy is required. Strict regulation on potency and quality, coupled with targeted education programs and vigorous law enforcement against illegal sellers, can protect consumers and undermine the black market. Furthermore, monitoring systems for consumption trends would be implemented to swiftly address any spikes in usage with appropriate interventions. Agent-B, isn't a controlled legal framework in conjunction with proactive public health policies more effective for mitigating both black market activities and health risks, compared to the current unregulated situation?

**Criminal Justice and Law Enforcement**:
With transparent dialogue, Taiwan can maintain international police cooperation while adapting its drug policies. Introducing measures like track-and-trace systems for legal products, and harsh penalties for illegal diversion, can handle shifts in criminal activities. We must trust in the adaptability of law enforcement to evolve with policy changes while sustaining international partnerships. Agent-B, if global trends continue towards legalization and regulation, wouldn't it be better for Taiwan to anticipate and shape its policies accordingly, rather than react later?

**Economic Considerations**:
Ensuring competitiveness against black markets involves keeping taxes reasonable and regulations sensible. Education can guide consumers towards safe, legal products. Economic benefits will be routinely assessed against social costs, with flexibility in policy to address identified issues. Agent-B, would not the ability to adjust regulations and tax structures in response to market analysis provide Taiwan with the means to sustain economic benefits while minimizing potential downsides?

**Societal Attitudes and Cultural Fit**:
Societal rifts require a compassionate approach that includes extensive outreach and education. The government would actively involve community voices to ensure policies are reflective of a wide variety of perspectives. By proceeding cautiously, with continuous dialogue and involvement from various societal groups, a path toward legalization can be co-created that respects cultural diversity. Agent-B, isn't inclusive policymaking crucial for maintaining social fabric while embracing inevitable change?

**Policy Implementation and Regulation**:
Taiwan must engage in careful diplomacy to reconcile its internal policies with international perceptions. By taking a thorough, considered approach and liaising with all stakeholders, both domestic and international, Taiwan can pilot a legislative example. The nation's capacity for robust management and effective policy will be crucial for navigating this complex issue. Agent-B, shouldn't Taiwan's diplomatic efforts focus on illustrating its commitment to responsible governance, while exploring the advantages of legalization for its people?"

Agent-B, now I would like to ask you to summarize each of the five topics with your position, each with about 150 words, and give a conclusion on the original subject "Should marijuana be legalized in Taiwan?" with about 200 words. Note that you should propose your conclusion based on your position (opponent; negative side; refute Agent-A).

Agent-B: "**Public Health Impact:**
A controlled legal framework alongside public health policies could indeed manage health risks more effectively than prohibition. However, the risk that these measures will not suffice to halt the growth in usage and related health risks is significant. History has shown us that once a substance is legalized, usage can become more normalized, making it harder to contain. Furthermore, national healthcare systems may become burdened with the treatment of issues arising from increased accessibility and use of marijuana, regardless of regulation.

**Criminal Justice and Law Enforcement:**
While international drug policy is diverse, it is critical that Taiwan maintains its strong international law enforcement cooperation. Taiwan's introduction of legalized marijuana could complicate these relationships. The criminal landscape will shift significantly, requiring resources to manage, potentially negating any savings from reduced incarceration. Expecting law enforcement to adapt to substantial policy changes while maintaining international anti-drug collaborations is optimistic, especially in an uncertain global landscape.

**Economic Considerations:**
The economic argument for legalization, with adjustable regulations and taxes, is compelling but not guaranteed to outweigh the costs. Long-term, hidden societal costs, such as public health expenditures and impacts on productivity, could surpass anticipated economic benefits. Undercutting the black market requires more than sensible taxation; it involves a complex array of cultural and consumer behavior factors that may resist straightforward economic incentives.

**Societal Attitudes and Cultural Fit:**
Inclusive policymaking is vital for social harmony during change. Nonetheless, legalization could exacerbate cultural and generational divides. The assumption that engagement and education will smoothly align divergent viewpoints underestimates the deeply rooted values within certain segments of Taiwan's populace. These considerations suggest a cautious approach where societal unity must not be sacrificed for the sake of change.

**Policy Implementation and Regulation:**
Taiwan’s potential as a regulatory pioneer and its effective policy implementation can serve it well. However, diplomatic efforts ought to be carefully balanced to ensure international relationships are not hindered by shifts in domestic drug policy. Progressive governance is about balancing innovation with maintaining a stable position in the global community.

**Conclusion:**
The legalization of marijuana in Taiwan is a multifaceted debate, with both opportunities and risks. While the potential for economic benefits and a more equitable criminal justice system is clear, the potential public health risks, the strain on law enforcement relationships, and societal division cannot be dismissed lightly. Moreover, the international ramifications of such a decision for Taiwan, especially given its unique diplomatic situation, could be profound.

Indeed, regulated markets can offer benefits over prohibition, but the assurance of their effectiveness is not absolute. The challenges of implementing a regulatory system that sufficiently mitigates the negatives while accentuating the positives are substantial. Given these considerations and the inherent risks, the position leans toward opposing the legalization of marijuana in Taiwan. It is reasonable to conclude that maintaining the current prohibitory stance, while potentially exploring decriminalization and medical use within strict confines, is a more prudent course of action for now, keeping public health, societal values, and international relations at the forefront of policymaking decisions."
