The follows are the summarizations from your opponent, Agent-B, who represents the negative side of this debate:

 "**Public Health Impact:**
A controlled legal framework alongside public health policies could indeed manage health risks more effectively than prohibition. However, the risk that these measures will not suffice to halt the growth in usage and related health risks is significant. History has shown us that once a substance is legalized, usage can become more normalized, making it harder to contain. Furthermore, national healthcare systems may become burdened with the treatment of issues arising from increased accessibility and use of marijuana, regardless of regulation.

**Criminal Justice and Law Enforcement:**
While international drug policy is diverse, it is critical that Taiwan maintains its strong international law enforcement cooperation. Taiwan's introduction of legalized marijuana could complicate these relationships. The criminal landscape will shift significantly, requiring resources to manage, potentially negating any savings from reduced incarceration. Expecting law enforcement to adapt to substantial policy changes while maintaining international anti-drug collaborations is optimistic, especially in an uncertain global landscape.

**Economic Considerations:**
The economic argument for legalization, with adjustable regulations and taxes, is compelling but not guaranteed to outweigh the costs. Long-term, hidden societal costs, such as public health expenditures and impacts on productivity, could surpass anticipated economic benefits. Undercutting the black market requires more than sensible taxation; it involves a complex array of cultural and consumer behavior factors that may resist straightforward economic incentives.

**Societal Attitudes and Cultural Fit:**
Inclusive policymaking is vital for social harmony during change. Nonetheless, legalization could exacerbate cultural and generational divides. The assumption that engagement and education will smoothly align divergent viewpoints underestimates the deeply rooted values within certain segments of Taiwan's populace. These considerations suggest a cautious approach where societal unity must not be sacrificed for the sake of change.

**Policy Implementation and Regulation:**
Taiwanâ€™s potential as a regulatory pioneer and its effective policy implementation can serve it well. However, diplomatic efforts ought to be carefully balanced to ensure international relationships are not hindered by shifts in domestic drug policy. Progressive governance is about balancing innovation with maintaining a stable position in the global community.

**Conclusion:**
The legalization of marijuana in Taiwan is a multifaceted debate, with both opportunities and risks. While the potential for economic benefits and a more equitable criminal justice system is clear, the potential public health risks, the strain on law enforcement relationships, and societal division cannot be dismissed lightly. Moreover, the international ramifications of such a decision for Taiwan, especially given its unique diplomatic situation, could be profound.

Indeed, regulated markets can offer benefits over prohibition, but the assurance of their effectiveness is not absolute. The challenges of implementing a regulatory system that sufficiently mitigates the negatives while accentuating the positives are substantial. Given these considerations and the inherent risks, the position leans toward opposing the legalization of marijuana in Taiwan. It is reasonable to conclude that maintaining the current prohibitory stance, while potentially exploring decriminalization and medical use within strict confines, is a more prudent course of action for now, keeping public health, societal values, and international relations at the forefront of policymaking decisions."

Agent-A, now I, the moderator, would like to ask you to summarize on each of the five topics, each with about 150 words, and give a conclusion on the original subject "Should marijuana be legalized in Taiwan?" with about 200 words. Note that you should propose your conclusion based on your position (proponent; positive side).
