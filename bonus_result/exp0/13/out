The follows are the summarizations from your opponent, Agent-B, who represents the negative side of this debate:

 "**1. Safety Summary:**

While temporary safety measures can help during the transition to two-stage left turns, they cannot fully guarantee the safety of motorcyclists. Immediate safety improvements typically undergo rigorous planning and gradual implementation with clear communication strategies to mitigate risks during transitional periods. Any period of adjustment that introduces untested intermediate stages in a high-risk maneuver adds uncertainty and could potentially compromise motorcyclist safety rather than enhancing it. Long-term safety solutions should not be pursued at the cost of introducing uncertain and possibly hazardous transitional practices.

**2. Traffic Flow Summary:**

Utilizing technology and public campaigns could indeed help manage the dynamic nature of two-stage left turn zones; however, fundamentally altering traffic flow systems requires careful consideration of overall impact and efficiency. The sporadic use of these zones adds an element of unpredictability, which could disrupt the flow and increase the possibility of accidents. Methodical, incremental changes to complex systems are essential to ensure that improvements in safety are not offset by reductions in traffic efficiency.

**3. Legal and Regulatory Implications Summary:**

While the adaptation of universal traffic laws with local modifications has proven successful in certain cases, the introduction of a specialized maneuver such as the two-stage left turn compounds legal complexity. It requires considerable alteration to existing frameworks and assumes consistent interpretation by all involved parties. These subjective elements, paired with the diverse traffic environments, call into question whether uniform enforcement can be realistically achieved without leading to potential inequality and confusion among road users.

**4. Rider Behavior and Decision Making Summary:**

Regular skill refreshment and assessment for riders may maintain certain levels of competency, yet they would demand significant enforcement resources and participant compliance. We have expectations for all drivers to maintain knowledge of complex maneuvers; however, avoiding added complexity where possible is key to overall road safety. The inherently risky nature of motorcycling combined with the introduction of a maneuver that significantly depends on the rider's judgment adds a layer of risk that is not easily offset by training alone.

**5. Infrastructure and Urban Planning Summary:**

Committing to equitable infrastructure development is critical, but conducting comprehensive analyses to justify resource allocation is equally important. Implementing multi-use zones may appropriately address multiple road user needs, but such changes must be carefully weighed against their potential to benefit a select group at the cost of wider accessibility and safety. Additionally, considering the finite nature of urban space and budgets, infrastructural changes must consider the impact on all road users to ensure compatibility with broad safety and efficiency goals.

**Conclusion:**

In conclusion, while the two-stage left turn may offer potential safety benefits for motorcyclists, significant concerns arise regarding its practical implementation, safety during transitional periods, traffic flow disruption, enforcement complexity, and demands on rider decision making. The theoretical benefits do not convincingly outweigh the additional risks and complexity introduced to all road users. Urban planning and infrastructure improvements should instead focus on more universally beneficial and less disruptive measures that protect vulnerable road users, such as enhanced visibility, dedicated signal phases, or even advanced vehicle-to-vehicle communication systems. Therefore, advocating for the mandatory implementation of the two-stage left turn for motorcycles does not appear to be the most effective, equitable, or feasible strategy for improving traffic safety in the current environment. Instead, efforts should concentrate on more holistic approaches to intersection safety that address the needs of all road users and prioritize straightforward, easily integrated practices."

Agent-A, now I, the moderator, would like to ask you to summarize on each of the five topics, each with about 150 words, and give a conclusion on the original subject "Should the motorcycle make a two-stage left turn?" with about 200 words. Note that you should propose your conclusion based on your position (proponent; positive side).
