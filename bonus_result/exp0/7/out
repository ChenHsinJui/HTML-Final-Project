The follows are the summarizations from your opponent, Agent-B, who represents the negative side of this debate:

 "1. Scientific Knowledge and Understanding:
Investing in space to obtain a holistic understanding of Earth's climate system presupposes an economy of scale that is speculative at best. The immediate crises that our planet faces – climate change, biodiversity loss, and environmental degradation – demand targeted action and definitive strategies, not auxiliary or tangential research. While space science can offer some broader context, it is secondary to the exigency of applying our current knowledge to implement and improve on-ground solutions that can provide substantial and tangible benefits to environmental stability.

2. Technological Advancements:
While space-related challenges might inspire ahead-of-their-time solutions, the direct application and relevance to immediate Earthly concerns are diffuse. Humanity faces pressing medical, environmental, and sociological problems that require dedicated research and solutions. By diverting a large portion of innovative energy towards the extraterrestrial, we risk neglecting vital opportunities for innovation that directly alleviate human suffering and societal challenges in the present.

3. Economic Impact:
While space programs may inspire and aspire towards a visionary future, the disproportionate allocation of resources towards space exploration runs the risk of skewing public policy and investment away from critical, immediate social needs. It creates opportunity costs in alleviating poverty, advancing education, and developing infrastructure – areas with proven, direct impacts on quality of life for populations globally. Real-world issues require real-time responses that can be constrained when fascination with space takes precedence over funding urgent developmental priorities.

4. Global Collaboration and Geopolitics:
Space as a platform for international collaboration is commendable but should not be mischaracterized as a panacea for geopolitical strife. The sheer scale of investment in space collaborations could instead be directed into resolving more pressing global challenges. While fostering unity through space endeavors seems idealistic, it is imperative to focus financial support on collaborative initiatives that deliver immediate relief, address environmental issues, and build necessary infrastructure to improve living conditions on Earth.

5. Long-term Survival and Human Expansion:
While contemplating future existential threats and off-world settlements may ignite the imagination, our current priority should lie in addressing the known issues threatening sustainable life on Earth. Innovations for hypothetical space habitats, though potentially insightful, remain a gamble, one which should not overshadow the imperative to leverage our resources and intellectual capital to secure the viability and stability of our home planet.

Conclusion:
In weighing the importance of space exploration, we must recognize its contributions to scientific advancement and consider the broader implications for Earth and humanity. However, as the opposition, I assert that the tangible benefits of space exploration do not currently outweigh the urgent and concrete priorities that confront us on Earth. While the pursuit of knowledge and the challenge of new frontiers carry intrinsic value, our collective efforts and resources must first address the pressing environmental, economic, and social crises facing our world today. Moreover, maintaining and elevating the quality of life for all human beings should take precedence over the uncertain and long-term prospects that space exploration promises. I conclude that space exploration, while still significant, should be meticulously balanced against more immediate concerns, ensuring that our exploratory ambitions do not lead to a misallocation of vital resources needed here on Earth."

Agent-A, now I, the moderator, would like to ask you to summarize on each of the five topics, each with about 150 words, and give a conclusion on the original subject "Is space exploration still important?" with about 200 words. Note that you should propose your conclusion based on your position (proponent; positive side).
