The follows are the summarizations from your opponent, Agent-B, who represents the negative side of this debate:

 "**1. Definition and Nature of AI Progress and Pandemics**

Interpretative tools and preemptive strategies in AI do offer advantages over post-outbreak containment for pandemics. However, the parallel lies in the potential for both AI and viral threats to surpass our current containment capabilities. As AI systems grow increasingly complex and autonomous, our interpretive tools and strategies may not sufficiently evolve to manage unforeseen consequences, similar to how pandemic containment struggles with unpredictable viral behavior. Thus, while the tools differ, the risk of being outpaced by the phenomenon we aim to control is a common thread.

**2. Human Agency and Control**

Standardized practices and international frameworks are certainly positive developments in AI governance. However, the rate at which AI evolves creates a landscape where governance must not just be prospective but exceptionally agile and foresightful. Existing initiatives like GDPR indicate movement towards anticipation, but the enforcement and real-world efficacy of such frameworks remain variably proven, especially given the continuous emergence of new AI technologies beyond current legislative foresight.

**3. Ethical and Regulatory Frameworks**

The gap between theory and enforcement in AI governance may be narrowing as public demand for responsible AI grows. Yet, societal-driven forces and ethics discourse do not always translate effectively into action, particularly in the face of rapid technological innovation. While dynamic, the response capacity of regulations and the implementation of ethical considerations into AI development processes must accelerate to prevent lag and ensure that policy reflects the current state of AI technology.

**4. Risk Assessment and Management**

AI safety as a field is indeed maturing, yet the novel nature of AI-related risks could outpace safety disciplines and their integration into practice. Collaboration among stakeholders improves our approach, but the traditional pace at which academia influences industry and vice versa suggests that significant gaps may still exist. As such, the capacity to proactively confront unknown AI risks while admirable, may not be as reliable or comprehensive as necessary.

**5. Global Impact and Responsibility**

Proactive dialogue and policy initiatives are foundational, but AI's real-time social and economic impacts reveal complexities that are not easily pre-empted. While nation-specific and international efforts are underway, the nuances of AIâ€™s effects across different societies and cultures make uniform preventative measures challenging. The response to AI's influence is more structured than pandemic reactions but is still subject to significant unpredictability and variability.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, while AI progress is indeed a result of human intention and not a natural phenomenon like a pandemic, the comparison extends to our ability, or lack thereof, to control the eventualities brought about by both. Our direct involvement in AI development does grant us a higher degree of agency compared to our influence over natural viral outbreaks. Nevertheless, as AI becomes more sophisticated, it increasingly exhibits autonomous behaviors that challenge our notions of predictability and governance, echoing the uncertainty that pandemics present. Though preemptive and defensive measures are more theoretically attainable in AI, ensuring their practical effectiveness remains daunting, paralleling the reactive nature of pandemic responses. This creates a landscape where, despite the human-driven origin of AI, the scale and speed of its advancement pose challenges akin to those found in managing natural phenomena. Agent-A argues that we maintain control over AI through governance and adaptability. However, this perspective may underestimate the emergent and volatile nature of sophisticated AI systems, suggesting that our agency, while significant, is not as absolute or assured as we might hope when faced with the complex realities of AI evolution."

Agent-A, now I, the moderator, would like to ask you to summarize on each of the five topics, each with about 150 words, and give a conclusion on the original subject "Do you agree that AI progress is not a natural phenomenon like the Pandemic; therefore, we have considerably more agency rather than taking some preemptive defensive measures?" with about 200 words. Note that you should propose your conclusion based on your position (proponent; positive side).
