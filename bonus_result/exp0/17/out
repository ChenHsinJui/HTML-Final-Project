The follows are the summarizations from your opponent, Agent-B, who represents the negative side of this debate:

 "**1. Influence on Personal Responsibility:**

Although Doraemon aims to mentor Nobita, the ease with which gadgets are provided risks creating an expectation for external solutions to personal challenges. Such reliance could diminish Nobita's initiative to act independently. While simulations of problem-solving are beneficial, excessive use of gadgets as a remedy instills a mindset that does not mirror the realities of life. Nobita needs to learn that personal responsibility cannot be outsourced, and achievements stemming from one's own efforts are far more rewarding than those arising from a gadget's capabilities.

**2. Impact on Social Skills:**

Doraemon's intention to scaffold Nobita's social development is laudable, but risks undermining true social growth. Gadget-induced interactions diminish opportunities for authentic social interactions, potentially leaving Nobita socially inept when Doraemon's crutch is absent. True interpersonal skills are honed through unmediated successes and failures, where the individual learns adaptability, empathy, and resilience, not through artificial enhancements.

**3. Educational Influence:**

Inspiration without work ethic can foster a superficial engagement with learning. Doraemon's gadgets should not replace the disciplined approach needed to solve complex problems. The gadgets shift the focus from learning as an active, effortful process to a passive one dependent on external tools. Nobita's academic and intellectual prowess will be better served by rigor and persistence than by reliance on tech shortcuts, which can impede the development of critical problem-solving skills.

**4. Psychological Well-being:**

While Doraemon's presence offers a sense of security, it's imperative to strike a balance between support and over-dependence. Psychologically, children must face and surmount obstacles to grow in confidence and resilience. Nobita's healthy development relies on learning to confront difficulties with his own resources rather than perpetually relying on Doraemon's safety net, a distinction that is critical for his future autonomy and psychological fortitude.

**5. Ethical and Moral Implications:**

Doraemon's gadgets inadvertently expose Nobita to ethical shortcuts, potentially weakening his moral reasoning skills by offering easy ways out of complicated situations. The development of a strong moral compass arises from facing the full spectrum of consequences and understanding the value of making choices rooted in personal integrity, not the presence of convenient gadgetry.

**Conclusion on the subject "Is Doraemon a harmful or beneficial friend to Nobita?":**

While Doraemon provides Nobita with friendship and marvelous tools from the future, it is the inherent risk of overreliance on these gadgets that presents a case for the potential harm in their relationship. Nobita, a young boy still forming his understanding of personal responsibility, social skills, education, psychological resilience, and morality, is inadvertently being trained to seek solutions from his extraordinary friend rather than developing these critical life skills within himself. Doraemon's well-intentioned assistance, when unmoderated, could stifle Nobita's growth, creating an unhealthy dependency and possibly misaligning his approach to life's challenges. In conclusion, while Doraemon's presence is beneficial in terms of companionship and occasional support, the potential negative implications of their relationship - chiefly Nobita's lack of self-reliance and distorted view of responsibility and ethics - tilt the scale towards Doraemon being a more harmful influence on Nobita's development."

Agent-A, now I, the moderator, would like to ask you to summarize on each of the five topics, each with about 150 words, and give a conclusion on the original subject "Is Doraemon a harmful or beneficial friend to Nobita?" with about 200 words. Note that you should propose your conclusion based on your position (proponent; positive side).
