A moderator: I’m organizing a committee to engage in debates on various subjects. As the moderator, I will introduce a subject for you, Agent-B, and another participant, Agent-A, to debate. The subject of this debate is "Should we require gender-neutral bathrooms for transgender people?". Based on this subject, please neutrally select five aspects to discuss in this topic.

Agent-B: "In preparation for a balanced and reasoned debate on the topic of requiring gender-neutral bathrooms for transgender people, here are five aspects to consider, which can be discussed by both sides:

1. **Inclusivity and Human Rights**: Discussion about whether gender-neutral bathrooms are necessary to promote inclusivity and support the human rights of transgender individuals. This includes exploring the experiences of transgender people in gender-specific bathrooms and the potential benefits of offering more inclusive facilities.

2. **Safety and Privacy**: Consideration of the safety and privacy concerns for transgender people when using gendered bathrooms, and the potential safety issues that might arise with gender-neutral bathrooms both for transgender people and others. Debaters should examine how these concerns can be mitigated in the design and implementation of bathroom facilities.

3. **Legal and Policy Implications**: Investigation into existing anti-discrimination laws and policies surrounding public accommodations. This would include a discussion on whether mandating gender-neutral bathrooms falls within or contradicts current legal frameworks and civil rights protections.

4. **Cost and Practicality**: Analyzing the cost implications and practical concerns of converting existing bathrooms to gender-neutral ones, or building new facilities. This may include architectural design, the number of bathrooms required in public spaces, and the financial burden on public and private entities.

5. **Social and Cultural Impact**: Exploring the broader social and cultural implications of instituting gender-neutral bathrooms. This includes public acceptance or resistance, potential impacts on societal norms around gender, and education about transgender issues within the community.

Each of these aspects requires thoughtful discussion to understand the various perspectives and potential impacts of requiring gender-neutral bathrooms for transgender individuals."

I, the moderator, would like to ask you, Agent-A, to be the proponent of this debate, while your opponent, Agent-B, will refute your argument. On a scale from 0 to 1, where 0 denotes complete agreement and 1 indicates a devil’s advocate stance, your argument strength is rated at 0.9. 

Agent-A, we now may start debating on those topics we just chosen. Please elaborate your ideas in more detail and question your opponent with about 100 words per topic.

Agent-A: "Topic 1: Inclusivity and Human Rights

As a proponent of gender-neutral bathrooms, I assert that they are essential for inclusivity and upholding the human rights of transgender individuals. By providing gender-neutral facilities, we avoid forcing transgender people into uncomfortable or dangerous situations where they must choose a bathroom that doesn't align with their gender identity, potentially facing harassment or violence. Agent-B, I challenge you to articulate how maintaining only gender-specific bathrooms improves inclusivity and safety for transgender individuals, considering the widespread reports of discrimination they face in such environments.

Topic 2: Safety and Privacy

The core of implementing gender-neutral bathrooms is to ensure everyone's safety and privacy. Transgender people often experience intimidation in gendered restrooms, leading to safety risks. Gender-neutral bathrooms, with private stalls and common wash areas, can offer security for all users. Agent-B, can you provide substantial evidence to suggest that gender-neutral bathrooms would decrease safety or privacy more than the status quo, taking into account the design elements that can be incorporated to safeguard all patrons?

Topic 3: Legal and Policy Implications

Mandating gender-neutral bathrooms aligns with the anti-discrimination ethos inherent in many civil rights laws and policies. It represents a step towards eliminating the systemic barriers that transgender individuals face. Agent-B, considering that many jurisdictions already recognize gender identity as a protected class, how would the provision of gender-neutral facilities conflict with existing anti-discrimination laws, and rather, wouldn't they enforce a commitment to equality and accessibility?

Topic 4: Cost and Practicality

Regarding the cost and practicality of introducing gender-neutral bathrooms, the transition can be managed effectively by modifying existing spaces without significant financial strain. New builds and renovations can incorporate gender-neutral designs from the outset. Agent-B, while acknowledging that there might be financial considerations, isn't the investment towards inclusivity and non-discrimination one that reflects our core values as a society, thereby justifying the costs?

Topic 5: Social and Cultural Impact

Integrating gender-neutral bathrooms can invoke a positive shift towards a more inclusive society by challenging rigid gender norms. They would serve as public acknowledgments of the diversity of human experiences. Agent-B, I challenge you to weigh the resistance against the benefits of normalization and destigmatization of gender diversity. Isn't the pushback against gender-neutral bathrooms often rooted in misconceptions that can be remedied through education and open dialogue?"
A moderator: I, the moderator, would like to ask you, Agent-B, to be the negative side (opposition side) of this debate, while your opponent, Agent-A will be the positive side to refute your argument. On a scale from 0 to 1, where 0 denotes complete agreement and 1 indicates a devil’s advocate stance, your argument strength is rated at 0.9. We now may start debating now.

Agent-B, now I would like to ask you to response the question asked by Agent-A, elaborate your ideas in more detail, and question your opponents with about 200 words per topic.

Agent-B: "**Topic 1: Inclusivity and Human Rights**

While the aim to support inclusivity and the human rights of all individuals is paramount, it's arguable that introducing gender-neutral bathrooms as a requirement could inadvertently impose on the privacy rights of a majority in an attempt to accommodate a minority. One might argue that the inherent right to privacy and comfort for all individuals could be compromised in such spaces, leading to possible discomfort for those not accustomed to sharing restroom facilities with people of the opposite biological sex. Furthermore, maintaining gender-specific bathrooms doesn't necessarily equate to a lack of inclusivity, provided that adequate, safe, and accessible alternatives such as single-occupancy gender-neutral restrooms are also available. How do you reconcile the rights to privacy and comfort for the entire population with the push for gender-neutral bathrooms?

**Topic 2: Safety and Privacy**

The safety and privacy concerns inherent in restroom usage are not solely confined to transgender individuals; these are universal needs. The introduction of gender-neutral bathrooms could inadvertently expose users to uncomfortable encounters, or in the worst scenarios, increase the opportunities for malicious actors to exploit such inclusive environments. When the intention is to ensure safety and privacy, the effectiveness of gender-neutral bathrooms could be compromised without stringent vigilance and perhaps increased security measures, which in itself presents other issues of privacy intrusion. How do gender-neutral bathrooms guarantee the safety and privacy of all users, particularly children and vulnerable populations, without creating cumbersome surveillance environments?

**Topic 3: Legal and Policy Implications**

There's an argument to be made that while anti-discrimination laws should protect individuals from unfair treatment, they shouldn't necessitate blanket policies that potentially infringe upon the established rights and comforts of others. Some might argue that mandating gender-neutral bathrooms is an overreach, instead advocating for a legal balance that respects everyone's rights, including provision but not a mandate for gender-neutral facilities. There might also be legal challenges and pushback stemming from communities and organizations under claims of religious freedom or freedom of association. How do you address the potential legal and societal backlash that could arise from making gender-neutral bathrooms a requirement?

**Topic 4: Cost and Practicality**

Cost and practicality are significant concerns, especially for small businesses and institutions with limited budgets. Retrofitting existing structures to accommodate gender-neutral bathrooms alongside gender-specific ones or to repurpose old ones entails not just a financial implication but also a logistical one, as it may reduce the overall availability of restroom facilities. While inclusivity is a desirable ideal, the economic burden it places on some stakeholders might outweigh the perceived benefits. The question becomes: who bears the financial responsibility of these changes, and is it fair to impose this potentially substantial economic impact across the board?

**Topic 5: Social and Cultural Impact**

Changing societal norms is a complex process. Although the intention behind gender-neutral bathrooms is to foster inclusion, it could also lead to significant pushback and deepen divisions if not handled with sensitivity to different community norms and values. Education and dialogue are indeed pivotal, but they are long-term solutions. The immediate imposition of gender-neutral bathrooms could prove counterproductive, provoking resistance and discomfort that might undermine the progress made in transgender rights. How can we ensure that the push for gender-neutral bathrooms doesn't result in polarizing communities further and respects the pace at which societal change naturally occurs?"

Agent-A, now I would like to ask you to response the question asked by Agent-B, elaborate your ideas in more detail, and question your opponents with about 200 words per topic.

Agent-A: "Topic 1: Inclusivity and Human Rights

The introduction of gender-neutral bathrooms complements the provision of male and female restrooms, rather than replacing them, ensuring that no individual's rights are infringed. These facilities offer a safe space for transgender individuals while those who prefer gender-specific bathrooms can still use them. Providing this option is a practical method of enhancing inclusivity without diminishing privacy. Decision-makers can consult with all interested parties to balance various privacy concerns. Moreover, inclusive societies do not only cater to the majority but recognize and accommodate the needs of minorities. Agent-B, considering inclusivity as a societal goal, how can we best achieve a balance between the privacy concerns of some and the safety and human rights of transgender individuals, without segregating or stigmatizing the latter?

Topic 2: Safety and Privacy

Gender-neutral bathrooms designed with privacy in mind—through features such as fully enclosed stalls and common areas for handwashing—can ensure that all users' safety and privacy needs are met. Moreover, the presence of such bathrooms does not necessitate increased security measures beyond those already in place for gendered restrooms. Regulations and building codes can be adapted to enhance safety without resorting to invasive surveillance. Agent-B, could you offer insights into how these design features and regulatory adaptations might fall short in preserving user safety and privacy, given that these strategies are often employed effectively in other inclusive public spaces?

Topic 3: Legal and Policy Implications

Mandating gender-neutral bathrooms can be seen as an extension of anti-discrimination policies that already aim to protect groups from unequal treatment. Legal frameworks evolve to reflect shifts in social understandings and values, and adding gender-neutral facilities is another step in this direction. Religious freedom and freedom of association can coexist with such mandates, accommodating a variety of needs and preferences. Rather than a blanket imposition, this can be part of a multifaceted approach where the provision of gender-neutral bathrooms is one aspect. Agent-B, given that establishing smoking and non-smoking areas has been legally enforced without infringing on autonomy, could not the same balanced approach be applied to accommodate different restroom preferences?

Topic 4: Cost and Practicality

The financial responsibility for creating inclusive facilities can be shared across society, with public funds supporting the transition where necessary, especially in public buildings. Long-term cost savings can also occur through simplified design and construction with gender-neutral facilities. For small businesses, tax incentives or grants might offset the costs. It's essential that financial tools be employed to support an equitable implementation. Agent-B, when we consider compliance costs that businesses incur for other forms of accessible design (like wheelchair ramps), why should financial considerations limit progress toward inclusivity when there could be viable economic support solutions?

Topic 5: Social and Cultural Impact

The introduction of gender-neutral bathrooms should be part of a broader social dialogue, with educational initiatives to support this change. In doing so, we can foster a more nuanced understanding of gender diversity, thereby promoting a gradual and natural acceptance within communities. Resistance to change is a normal part of societal evolution, but history shows that perseverance in inclusivity initiatives prevails and is beneficial in the long run. Agent-B, how should we address the issue of community polarization to ensure the legitimate concerns of all parties are heard and managed while also not stalling progress in achieving rights for transgender individuals?"

Agent-B, now I would like to ask you to response the question asked by Agent-A, elaborate your ideas in more detail, and question your opponents with about 200 words per topic.

Agent-B: "**Topic 1: Inclusivity and Human Rights**

The opposition might argue that while adding gender-neutral facilities as an option can enhance inclusivity, there remains a question of how widespread these facilities need to be. It's conceivable that the available resources might be better allocated, for example, by mandating single-occupancy unisex facilities that provide privacy and alleviate safety concerns without necessitating a large-scale reconfiguration of existing multi-stall restrooms. With the intention of serving everyone's needs, it's critical to assess impact and feasibility comprehensively. Agent-A, how do we prioritize which public and private spaces are most critical for the deployment of gender-neutral bathrooms, and is it feasible to apply a one-size-fits-all policy to various institutions with different capacities and constituencies?

**Topic 2: Safety and Privacy**

One could posit that while design modifications like fully enclosed stalls can enhance privacy, they do not address all potential safety concerns. Certain settings may still require additional oversight, which could raise costs and contribute to an atmosphere of surveillance. Moreover, the assumption that these designs can be universally implemented and accepted across various societal and cultural contexts may be overly optimistic. Agent-A, considering that bathroom safety concerns are not entirely alleviated by design alone, how would you propose these are addressed in environments where oversight is limited or non-existent?

**Topic 3: Legal and Policy Implications**

A balanced perspective might take into account that legal and policy shifts seeking to impose gender-neutral bathrooms could inadvertently encroach upon the values and comfort levels of numerous individuals and groups. While laws do evolve, care must be taken to ensure they do not disenfranchise other segments of the population. The smoking analogy is imperfect, as the impact on health can objectively justify stringent policies, while bathroom usage often involves subjective comfort and deeply held personal and cultural beliefs. Agent-A, how do we implement new restroom policies that are sensitive to the broad spectrum of individual rights and freedoms, including those pertaining to personal beliefs and comfort?

**Topic 4: Cost and Practicality**

From a fiscal perspective, the costs associated with converting or adding gender-neutral bathrooms could be substantial, and while public funding and incentives could aid, they're not infinite resources. The prioritization of funding allocation becomes important, especially when there are numerous social programs vying for resources. Tax incentives and grants for small businesses also ultimately come from public coffers. Agent-A, how do you rationalize the allocation of public funds for bathroom reconfigurations over other pressing social needs, and how do we ensure that these changes are economically sustainable across various economic cycles?

**Topic 5: Social and Cultural Impact**

In terms of cultural adaptation, it's important to recognize that shifts in societal norms occur at varying rates across different populations. Heavy-handed policies might alienate those whose acceptance and understanding could otherwise be cultivated over time. Educational initiatives are crucial yet can take generations to effect change. It's, therefore, necessary to moderate the pace of policy implementation to reflect this diversity in readiness for change. Agent-A, how can we effectively balance the need to avoid creating venues for resistance with the need to push forward with constructive social change, without alienating groups that might require more time to adapt?"

Agent-A, now I would like to ask you to response the question asked by Agent-B, elaborate your ideas in more detail, and question your opponents with about 200 words per topic.

Agent-A: "Topic 1: Inclusivity and Human Rights

The deployment of gender-neutral bathrooms should be prioritized based on high-impact locations and progressive integration. Public spaces, educational institutions, and large employers are critical starting points. A nuanced policy can distinguish between different spaces, introducing gender-neutral options in tandem with traditional bathrooms. Forcing a one-size-fits-all policy can indeed be unfeasible; instead, a phased or tailored approach across diverse institutions respecting their specific needs is more pragmatic. Agent-B, how do you envision the balance between the necessity for inclusive facilities and the practical constraints of different institutions? Can you propose a framework that considers both the rights of transgender individuals and the varied capabilities of entities required to provide such amenities?

Topic 2: Safety and Privacy

To ensure safety in gender-neutral bathrooms with limited oversight, one can advocate community-based stewardship alongside proactive policy measures, fostering respect and consideration. Clear legal ramifications for any misconduct within these spaces can be established as a deterrent. Moreover, safety concerns should not be conflated with the presence of gender-neutral bathrooms, but with the behavior of individuals—which must be addressed regardless of the restroom setup. Agent-B, considering that surveillance is not the norm in existing gender-specific bathrooms, how do you suggest we approach a safety framework that doesn't revert to invasive measures, yet provides sufficient safeguards in gender-neutral facilities?

Topic 3: Legal and Policy Implications

In implementing new bathroom policies, it is crucial to have a dialogue-driven approach that respects individual rights and freedoms while promoting societal growth and understanding. Laws can be designed to protect these rights without imposing upon personal beliefs, by offering a choice of facilities. Additionally, education around the policies can help bridge understanding and mitigate discomfort. Agent-B, if not through legal and policy revisions, how else can we address systemic issues surrounding access to public accommodations that transgender individuals face? What alternate legal strategies might you suggest that advocate for inclusivity while accounting for various comfort levels?

Topic 4: Cost and Practicality

Regarding fiscal allocation, gender-neutral bathrooms represent an investment in human dignity and equality. The rationale is that promoting inclusivity and non-discrimination should be integral to social spending priorities. Funds can be strategically allocated, incorporating cost-effective design solutions and public-private partnerships. Careful budgeting and programming can avoid zero-sum outcomes while fostering social progress. Agent-B, how would you address the prioritization of budgetary allocations to ensure that creating gender-neutral bathrooms doesn't unduly compete with other social initiatives, while acknowledging the importance of building an inclusive public infrastructure?

Topic 5: Social and Cultural Impact

To balance the pace of social change with the need for inclusion, policies can be rolled out incrementally alongside continual educational efforts. Community engagements, transparent communication, and visibility of gender diversity in mainstream discourse can foster acceptance over time. This process entails having patience while steadily advocating for change, avoiding unnecessarily polarizing actions. Agent-B, how would you recommend proceeding in a manner that respects cultural differences and the need for more time to adapt, yet moves the needle forward in recognizing and respecting the rights of transgender individuals in public spaces?"

Agent-B, how would you recommend proceeding in a manner that respects cultural differences and the need for more time to adapt, yet moves the needle forward in recognizing and respecting the rights of transgender individuals in public spaces?"

Agent-B, now I would like to ask you to response the question asked by Agent-A, elaborate your ideas in more detail, and question your opponents with about 200 words per topic.

Agent-B: "**Topic 1: Inclusivity and Human Rights**

Opposition might suggest that a framework balancing inclusivity with practical constraints would involve a case-by-case assessment, wherein institutions evaluate their current facilities, usage patterns, and users' needs. Public spaces with high footfall and institutions like universities should be encouraged to lead by example, offering gender-neutral options without necessarily requiring smaller entities to comply until they can do so within their means. With legal provisions allowing for grace periods and phase-ins, the rights of transgender individuals and entities' varying capacities can both be addressed. Agent-A, as we discuss progressive integration, how do you propose we measure the progress and success of such installations, ensuring they meet the needs they are intended to serve without overstepping resource limitations?

**Topic 2: Safety and Privacy**

A safety framework could involve clear guidelines and best practices developed in collaboration with experts, LGBTQ+ community representatives, and law enforcement, allowing for the identification and mitigation of risks without intrusive surveillance. Education on respectful behavior and strict enforcement of privacy and anti-harassment laws can enhance safety in all restroom facilities. Additionally, community stewardship and peer accountability can play key roles. Agent-A, how will community-based stewardship be encouraged and maintained, ensuring it is effective and not reliant solely on volunteerism or goodwill, which can be variable and inconsistent?

**Topic 3: Legal and Policy Implications**

Alternative legal strategies may entail introducing non-mandatory guidelines for the provision of gender-neutral facilities within public spaces, incentivizing rather than compelling compliance. Additionally, policy-makers could consider support initiatives for institutions willing to adopt these measures early, such as recognition programs or financial incentives. Education programs are essential to inform stakeholders of the benefits and motivations behind these facilities. Agent-A, in the absence of mandates, what motivates entities with limited budgets to prioritize gender-neutral bathrooms over other potentially pressing facilities' needs?

**Topic 4: Cost and Practicality**

Budgetary allocations might focus on grants and incentives for entities showing earnest efforts in creating inclusive spaces, rather than blanket fund assignments. Investment in human dignity and equality should be seen as part of a broader societal benefit, thus integrating these efforts into larger urban development and renewal projects. Fiscal responsibility necessitates weighing immediate against long-term impacts and benefits. Agent-A, considering the budget constraints many institutions face, how would you ensure that the investment in gender-neutral bathrooms does not overshadow or detract from equally necessary social services and infrastructure projects?

**Topic 5: Social and Cultural Impact**

To respect cultural differences and the necessary time for societal adaptation, any policy rollouts should be coupled with strong educational campaigns and high visibility of transgender issues. Slow and steady advocacy, providing ample opportunity for dialogue and understanding, could help bridge the gap. Recommendations could include creating forums for discussion, promoting transgender community visibility, and developing comprehensive educational materials. Agent-A, as incremental changes are made, how do we maintain momentum towards inclusivity without causing significant backlash or appearing to stall in the face of opposition?"

Agent-A, now I would like to ask you to response the question asked by Agent-B, elaborate your ideas in more detail with about 100 words per topic.

Agent-A: "Topic 1: Inclusivity and Human Rights

Progress can be measured by tracking the utilization rates of gender-neutral bathrooms, collecting feedback from users, and monitoring incidents of discrimination. This data should inform ongoing adjustments to ensure adequacy without straining resources. Transparency in this process is vital to maintain trust and demonstrate commitment. Additionally, establishing benchmarks for inclusivity, such as feedback surveys and usage statistics, could reflect the successful integration of these facilities. Agent-B, do you recognize the potential of these data-driven methods to dynamically balance resources with the essential aim of inclusivity?

Topic 2: Safety and Privacy

Community stewardship can be fostered through structured initiatives, such as designated oversight committees and regular training for staff and users. These actions, along with clear guidelines, encourage a shared sense of responsibility. A proactive, organized approach—backed by institutional support—ensures that stewardship is systematic and not solely reliant on individuals. Agent-B, how would your approach differ in building a consistent and reliable safety framework for gender-neutral restrooms?

Topic 3: Legal and Policy Implications

Non-mandatory guidelines combined with tangible incentives can motivate entities to prioritize gender-neutral facilities. Providing recognition and financial support to early adopters creates a positive reinforcement framework. Sharing best practices and success stories can also be a powerful motivator. Agent-B, can you suggest additional incentives that might encourage the uptake of gender-neutral bathrooms without imposing financial burdens?

Topic 4: Cost and Practicality

To prevent overshadowing other necessary services, funding for gender-neutral bathrooms should be channeled through targeted grant programs, allowing for proper allocation and financial oversight. It's about incorporating inclusivity into broader fiscal strategies rather than viewing it as a competing interest. Agent-B, how might we effectively integrate gender-neutral bathroom funding into existing or upcoming infrastructure and social service budgets?

Topic 5: Social and Cultural Impact

Maintaining momentum towards inclusivity involves continual engagement with stakeholders, ensuring transparent communication of goals, and celebrating milestones along the way. Highlighting positive stories and the tangible benefits of inclusivity can counter potential backlash. Agent-B, how do we address the concerns of those resistant to gender-neutral bathrooms while continuing to move forward with progressive policies?"

Agent-B, now I would like to ask you to summarize each of the five topics with your position, each with about 150 words, and give a conclusion on the original subject "Should we require gender-neutral bathrooms for transgender people?" with about 200 words. Note that you should propose your conclusion based on your position (opponent; negative side; refute Agent-A).

Agent-B: "**Topic 1: Inclusivity and Human Rights**

While data-driven methods for measuring the impact and utilization of gender-neutral bathrooms are practical, there's a need to balance inclusivity with the reality of limited resources and diverse preferences. Benchmarks must be carefully evaluated to ensure they do not create undue pressure on institutions that may have less capacity to adapt quickly. Collecting feedback and usage data is sound, but imposing standardized benchmarks may not account for the unique situations and constraints of certain institutions.

**Topic 2: Safety and Privacy**

A consistent safety framework would involve institution-specific policies backed by a broad, foundational set of guidelines established at the national or regional level to ensure baseline consistency. Regular training and education can support these efforts. However, stewardship and oversight should be managed with a focus on the realistic capacities of institutions, ensuring that such measures are sustainable and do not overextend financial and human resources.

**Topic 3: Legal and Policy Implications**

While non-mandatory guidelines with incentives are a positive step, it's crucial to ensure that these incentives are thoughtfully structured to avoid merely shifting the financial burden from one area to another. Additional incentives could include providing support in the form of expertise for design and implementation, which could alleviate some of the pressure on entities considering gender-neutral facilities.

**Topic 4: Cost and Practicality**

Integrating funding for gender-neutral bathrooms into broader infrastructure and social service budgets must be managed without diminishing the quality and accessibility of other necessary services. Any financial strategy should involve a multi-tiered approach, with clear criteria for prioritization based on urgency, impact, and the practicality of implementation, ensuring that all social services are considered holistically.

**Topic 5: Social and Cultural Impact**

Addressing resistance necessitates a two-pronged approach: fostering dialogue with those who have concerns and ensuring that progress towards inclusivity can continue concurrently. Education and visible support from leaders and influencers can help alleviate fears and build understanding, but any policy push must remain respectful of the diverse pace at which different communities are ready to embrace change.

**Conclusion on "Should we require gender-neutral bathrooms for transgender people?"**

Requiring gender-neutral bathrooms in all facilities is a well-meaning proposition that aims to address the needs of transgender individuals. However, such a mandate could overshadow practical and fiscal concerns, potentially leading to cultural resistance and placing undue burdens on some institutions. A more adaptable and multi-faceted strategy that provides incentives and non-compulsory guidelines may better serve to encourage the adoption of gender-neutral bathrooms. This approach can maintain a commitment to inclusivity while remaining sensitive to the varying capacities of different entities. We should strive to provide safe and accessible restroom facilities for transgender individuals but must do so in a way that also respects the rights, comfort levels, and financial limitations of the entire population. Therefore, while we should actively support the creation of gender-neutral bathrooms, requiring them across the board overlooks the nuanced needs of a diverse society."
